    "\n",
    "Or you can ssh into the robots raspberry pie navigate to /var/lib/jupyter/notebooks (I have done this) and then you can probably start a jupyter notebook from there. To ssh into the robot you would need the IP and if you use the wired IP (can be found in the Opentrons-APP) you need to look that up again every time you connect as it changes. You could also try go via the WLAN (different IP, probalby permenent). \n",

    "### Labware\n",
    "All predefined labware can be found at at the [labware library](https://labware.opentrons.com/).\n",
    "Otherwise we might need to do a custom labware definition which should be doable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current definitions are:\n",
    "* _culture_wellplate_: 96-Wellplate on deckslot 2 containing the 230ul of medium inoculated with a bacteria culture. \n",
    "This is currently a [corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat](https://labware.opentrons.com/corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat?category=wellPlate). I understand that you want a non-flat bottom but this is the only wellplate I found that is neither a pcr nor a deep wellplate. You might want to choose a different wellplate.\n",
    "* _target_wellplate_: 96-Wellplate on deckslot 1 that is initially empty. Again this is currently a [corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat](https://labware.opentrons.com/corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat?category=wellPlate), you might want to change that.\n",
    "* _glycerol_wellplate_: 96-Deep-Wellplate on deckslot 4 containing glycerol. This is currently a [opentrons_96_deep_well_adapter_nest_wellplate_2ml_deep](https://labware.opentrons.com/opentrons_96_deep_well_adapter_nest_wellplate_2ml_deep), a V-bottom with 2ml volume per well. This might have to be adjusted aswell.\n",
    "* _tiprack_300ul_1_: a tiprack with 96 300ul no filter tips on deckslot 3. See [detail](https://labware.opentrons.com/opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul?category=tipRack).\n",
    "* _tiprack_300ul_2_: Same as above on deckslot 5. Only needed at all if you are using all 96 wells. Only ever needs to contain 1 tip in upper left slot. This is the additional tip you need for dispensing the glycerol in step 1 if you need 96 tips in step 2 (96 wells used -> 96 culture transfers in step 2 -> 96 tips needed for step 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. transfer 115ul from _glycerol_wellplate_ to each well in _target_wellplate_.\n",
    "2. transfer 115ul from each well in _culture_wellplate_ to each well in _target_wellplate_.\n",
    "3. mix content of _target_wellplate_ by aspirateing and dispensing into the same well a few times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To save tips steps 2 and 3 are performed in paralell, meaning after each transfer from a _culture_wellplate_ to a _target_wellplate_ the pipette will mix the content of the _target_wellplate_ by aspirating and dispensing a few times."
